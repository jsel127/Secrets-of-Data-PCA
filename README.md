**Abstract**: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of dimensionality reduction techniques, focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). The investigation begins with the mathematical underpinnings of PCA, discussing eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and data transformation into a lower-dimensional space with applications in fields such as machine learning and signal processing.
The following section discusses Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), which can preserve pairwise distances and create reduced-dimensional representations. The mathematical framework of MDS, encompassing both metric and nonmetric variants, is studied, along with applications in psychology and bioinformatics.
Lastly, this paper introduces a data visualization platform utilizing PCA and MDS. This drafting website connects theory and practice to explore datasets, applying PCA and MDS to observe visualizations in reduced-dimensional spaces and gain insights into data structure and relationships.
